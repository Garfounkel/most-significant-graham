A high weight in tfâ€“idf is reached by a high term frequency (in the given document) and a low document
frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents; the weights hence tend to filter out common terms.
Since the ratio inside the idf's log function is always greater than or equal to 1, the value of idf (and tf-idf) is greater 
than or equal to 0. As a term appears in more documents, the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1, bringing the idf and tf-idf closer to 0.
